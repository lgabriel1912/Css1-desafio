# CSS1 Challenge - My First Web Design Project 🎨💻

Welcome to my **CSS1 Challenge**! This is my first web design project, where I focused on building a simple and visually appealing website using **HTML** and **CSS**. It's part of my learning process to improve my front-end development skills and dive deep into the world of **CSS**.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project is all about mastering **CSS** and using it to create an aesthetically pleasing webpage with a clean and structured design. I’ve applied custom styles, typography, and simple animations to make the website engaging for users.

### **Key Features**

- A modern, visually clean layout with custom **CSS** styles.
- Smooth typography and attention to detail in the design.
- **Hover effects** and **transitions** for a polished user experience.
- Simple, **static content** with no JavaScript used in this version.
